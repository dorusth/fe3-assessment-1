## Background
For the Assessment we had to chose a dataset and visualize it in a graph.
The dataset I chose was the data set about people who speak a certain language in the world.

## Changes/process
I started out width the bar chart from the first class and worked with that to visualize the data.

first-off i changed the rows the script was looking for in the TCV so the data would be shown in the graph, removed the "%" with the Y value and set the tick amount to 16.

Next I gave the bars a fill that changes every time you reload the page and added a different color for the hover which is a fixed color.
